# NSS Exercise - The Static Web - Blog
### Description:

> Create basic structure for a blog using only HTML.

Build a basic blog page that has 5 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this lorem ipsum text generator for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ).

1. There should be a page header containing the blog's title.
2. There should be a page footer containing the copyright notice. View pretty much any web site to see an example.
3. Each article has a header containing a title.
4. Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
5. Each article has at least one section.
